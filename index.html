      Ramahoney and the three villagers: Ramahoney was walking in the forest when three honeyers approached him. They told Ramahoney that if he wanted to be a real honey king, he'd have to climb the honey tower of light. He said it was an easy challenge. On the first floor, a queen bee was perched on a candleholder. Ramahoney said they were mad to make a queen bee the easiest challenge. He imagined what would be on the last floor. 

 After he reached the 100th floor, he was exhausted. Three bears were waiting for him. The villagers gave him a shield to protect him. He then saw a tree with a beehive near the window. He used the shield to break the window. The bears smelled the golden honey and ran to the window. They lost their balance and fell onto a tree. Ramahoney had completed the tower!
